# RGSS Tests

This is a set of test codes, which describe behaviors of RGSS/RGSS2/RGSS3.  It may be useful for development of compatible engines.

Note: some tests might be too precise. Sometimes you may better ignore such tests.

## Usage (for the official RGSS engine)

```
$ cd RGSS3Test1
$ cp somewhere/Game.exe ./Game.exe
$ cp somewhere/System/RGSS301.dll ./System/RGSS301.dll
$ make test
```
